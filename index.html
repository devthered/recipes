          <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>285 g (2 cups) flour</li>
            <li>40 g (3 tbsp) sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>70 g (5 tbsp) cold unsalted butter</li>
            <li>120 g (1 cup) heavy cream (or buttermilk or coconut milk)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Preheat oven to 425˚F. 
            <br><br>
            Combine dry ingredients and butter with food processor or fingertips until mixture resembles coarse sand. Stir in any mix-ins. Then put the mixture in the freezer for 15 minutes, or overnight for easy scones tomorrow morning.
            <br><br>
            Stir in cream until a dough begins to form. Then transfer to a floured work surface and knead together until the dough just comes together in a rough, slightly sticky ball. Gently pat dough into a ¾-inch-think circle, and cut into 8 wedges. Bake until tops are light brown, 12-15 minutes. Let cool on rack for 10 minutes before serving with butter (or clotted cream if available) and jam.
            <br><br>
            <b>Variations:</b><br>
            <i>Jalapeno Cheddar:</i> omit sugar. Add only 3 tbsp butter along with 4 oz sharp cheddar cheese. Add ½ cup jalapenos.<br>
            <i>Cranberry Orange:</i> add ½ cup cranberries, the zest of an orange, and 2 tbsp orange liqueur.<br>
            <i>Ginger, Lemon, Mint:</i> add ½ cup crystallized ginger, the zest of a lemon, 2 tbsp lemon juice or extract, and ¼ cup chopped mint.

          <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1/2 head garlic, separated and peeled </li>
            <li>1 bunch parsley, rinsed </li>
            <li>1/2 cup good quality olive oil </li>
            <li>1 tsp red pepper flakes </li>
            <li>1/2 lb dry linguine </li>

          <p>
            Heavily salt a large pot of water, and bring to a boil. Cook pasta to al dente while completing the steps below. 
            <br><br>
            Slice the garlic cloves thinly, and set aside. Pick the parsley leaves from their stems, and finely chop. Add olive oil to a large sauté pan, and heat over medium flame until shimmering. Add sliced garlic, stirring constantly, until garlic is barely toasted. Add the red pepper flake and remove from heat. 
            <br><br>
            Add the pasta, drained, with about 1/4 cup reserved pasta cooking water. Add lemon juice and parsley, and toss to combine. Season for salt and pepper, and serve.
